# Google Books API Project

This project required us to create a page that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API.

Tech stack:

-   React
-   React Router DOM
-   Javascript
-   SCSS
-   Asynchronous programming using Goggle Books API

This is my first project using react! The site uses components and containers and fetches data from the Google Books API using multiple parameters before cleaning and displaying it. It's responsive to screen size and uses BrowserRouter to route to different parts.

I spent a good bit of time just understanding the API and the data that it returned in order to clean it. I tried to make the components reusable so they could be reused across multiple pages.

This project is still a work in progress. I was able to create a new route to load additional information on the selected book but for future I hope to:

-   open additional information in a modal
-   show result page number
-   add buttons to move between pages of results
-   search by author when author name is clicked
